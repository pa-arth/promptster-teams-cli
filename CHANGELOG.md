# Changelog

All notable changes to `promptster-teams` are documented here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Repository reorganized for external security review: dead hook/Cursor
  normalization code removed, source moved into `cmd/` + `internal/` packages.
- CI hardened: cross-platform build/test matrix, race + coverage, `gofmt` and
  `staticcheck` gates, `gosec` SAST and `govulncheck` (both publishing SARIF to
  the GitHub Security tab), CodeQL, and a gitleaks self-scan. GitHub Actions
  pinned by commit SHA; Dependabot enabled.
- Release integrity: `SHA256SUMS` published per release, `install.sh` verifies
  the download before executing it, and npm publishes with build provenance.

### Removed
- Internal `docs/teams-cli-e2e-findings.md` engineering work-log (no longer part
  of the published repository).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Opt-in assistant-prose capture (org-gated, default off)** — when an org
  turns it on, the CLI keeps assistant response narration instead of dropping it
  entirely. The policy is fetched from `GET /v1/teams/policy`
  (`{ captureAssistantProse }`), refreshed at watch start and every 10 minutes,
  cached to the state dir, and **fail-closed**: any error (network, non-200,
  unparseable, teams-not-configured 503, or no cache) resolves to false, so prose
  is only ever captured when the backend affirmatively opts the org in.
- **`scrubAssistantProse` on-device scrubber** — before any kept assistant text
  is signed, buffered, or sent, code is stripped out on-device: fenced code
  blocks and anchored diff/patch runs collapse to a `<code-redacted>` marker, and
  over-long inline backtick spans are redacted, while narration and short symbol
  references (`useState`, `src/x.ts`) survive. Byte-for-byte lockstep with the
  backend scrubber, so the never-store-source guarantee holds even with prose
  capture enabled.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Client-side source exclusion** — a default-deny field allowlist strips
  diffs, file contents, command output, and assistant text on-device, so source
  content is never transmitted.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Efficiency telemetry** — usage attribution, prompt commands, compact
  triggers, and a config census (skills/plugins/MCP token accounting).
- **Presence heartbeat** — a content-free event that distinguishes an
  installed-but-idle seat from one where the CLI was never installed.
- **On-device PII redaction** and broader credential coverage.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- `login` setup TUI and per-developer (`PSE-`) keys.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- Default ingest path set to `/v1/teams/ingest`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-29

### Added
- Initial release: on-device, auditable AI-coding capture for teams — tails
  Claude Code + Codex transcripts, redacts on-device, signs into a
  tamper-evident chain, and streams to a team backend.
